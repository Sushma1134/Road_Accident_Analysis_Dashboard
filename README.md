## Data Sources
Road Accident: The dataset used for the project is the "Road Accident Data.xlsx" file, which contains all the information about Roads and types of accidents that happened in the year 2021-2022.

## Tools 
- Microsoft Excel - Data cleaning and creating Dashboard in Excel

### Data Cleaning / Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we have to perform the following tasks:
1. Data Loading and inspecting the data
2. Remove Unwanted or Unnecessary columns 
3. Check for null values, If null values are there remove them.
4. Data Cleaning  

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is involved in exploring the Road Accident data to answer key questions, such as :
1. What are the total casualties taken placed after the Accident?
2. What is the Total casualties & percentage of casualties that happened based on accident severity?
3. What is the Maximum number of casualties that happened by Vehicle type?
4. Total casualties with respect to all vehicle types?
5. Monthly trend between current year and previous year casualties
6. Maximum Number of casualties by Road type.
7. Distribution of total casualties by Road Surface
8. Total casualties based on location and by time means day/night.


### Data Analysis
 
 Data Analysis is done in the same Excel workbook "Road Accident Data.xlsx" in different worksheets and formed a dashboard report in the same Excel workbook under the name of Dashboard.

 ### Results 
As per the results,
- Total Casualties are 417883.
- Slight severity has the highest casualties compared to fatal and serious severity.
- Maximum casualties based on vehicle type are done by cars with 333485 accidents which are around 79%
- Most number casualties happened by Single carriageway Road type.
- Most number casualties happened on Dry surfaces compared to Wet and Ice/Snow surfaces.
- Highest number of casualties happened in urban areas compared to Rural Areas.
- Highest number of casualties happened in Dark(Night) time only.
